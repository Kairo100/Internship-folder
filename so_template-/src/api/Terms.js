        heading: "11. Campaign Owners",
        content: `Campaign Owners are permitted to offer Perks to Contributors. Campaign Owners are legally bound to perform on any promise and/or commitment to Contributors (including delivering any Perks). This commitment includes shipping Perks to SOKAAB Contributors before fulfilling any orders received after the Campaign has ended. For Campaign Owners participating in programs with our retail partners, failure to ship orders to SOKAAB Contributors first may result in removal from such retail partnership programs.
<br></br>
Campaign Owners will respond promptly and truthfully to all questions posed to them by SOKAAB or any Contributor. Campaign Owners will provide substantive and quality updates at least once a month to their Contributors. Failure to do so may result in punitive actions taken on the Campaign. If any Campaign Owner is unable to fulfill any of its commitments to Contributors (including delivering any Perks), the Campaign Owner will work with the Contributors to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include refunding their Contributions.
<br></br>
Your location as reflected on your Campaign page must match your legal residence that you submit to SOKAAB when you create the Campaign. Campaign Owners may not create multiple Campaigns without proof of meeting fulfillment obligations from the original Campaign. Failure to adequately fulfill Campaign obligations may result in SOKAAB removing the Campaign(s) from SOKAAB, and seeking reimbursement of Campaign funds raised, including by using third-party collections services. Only the Campaign Owner shall be permitted to collect Campaign funds. SOKAAB will not be required to disburse Campaign funds to any third parties.
<br></br>
Campaign Owners will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the use of Contributions and delivery of Perks. Campaign Owners are responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes on Contributions, and any taxes due in connection with Perks. Campaign Owners may not use a false email address to self-fund, or contribute to, their own Campaigns; this is a violation of Stripe policies and of our Terms of Use.
<br></br>
SOKAAB may attempt to verify the identity and other information provided to us by Campaign Owners, and we may delay, withhold, reverse or refund any Contributions or other amounts without notice or liability in the event we are unable to verify any such information to our satisfaction. Campaign Owner eligibility is subject to SOKAAB’s review of the fulfillment status of prior crowdfunding obligations. SOKAAB reserves the right to prohibit or remove a Campaign if the Campaign Owner is delayed by three months or more in fulfilling a prior crowdfunding project on SOKAAB or another platform.
<br></br>
If the amounts raised by a Campaign on SOKAAB exceed a certain threshold, and/or a Campaign has a high number of refunds or chargebacks (each as determined by SOKAAB in its sole discretion), SOKAAB may withhold a percentage of the Campaign funds for period of time as determined by SOKAAB in its discretion and in accordance with Campaign reviews. SOKAAB will manage all refunds during this time. The minimum goal set by a Campaign Owner must be at least $500. This is applied to Campaigns with either Fixed or Flexible funding.
<br></br>
You acknowledge that as a Campaign Owner, if you do not act in accordance with SOKAAB’s Terms, SOKAAB may obtain reimbursement of any amounts owed by a Campaign Owner to SOKAAB by holding funds from your Campaign, or from the connected Stripe or bank account associated with your Campaign, or by seeking reimbursement from the Campaign Owner by any other lawful means, including by using third-party collections services.`  },
